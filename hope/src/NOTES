and also in the file HISTORY.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

The parser is built using yacc.  Infix operators are implemented by
a series of left- and right-associative tokens, all represented in
yyparse.y by the symbol BINARY.  The file is preprocessed with the sed
scripts op.sed and Assoc.sed to replicate all lines mentioning BINARY.
This means that C compiler error messages will refer to lines in
yyparse.c, not yyparse.y.  The file op.sed is itself generated by
Mult-op.awk from op.h.  All this is done automatically by the Makefile.

If you add files or change the #include's, run 'make depend' to update
make's dependency information.

Read the comment in memory.c before you contemplate allocating memory.

To test your changes, run "make check".

If you've changed compilation or the interpreter, enable the definition
of STATS (print space usage statistics) in runtime.c for testing.

If something goes wrong with the interpreter, try defining TRACE in
interpret.c for more information.
