I originally wrote this interpreter to have a well-behaved implementation
of a simple functional language for use with an undergraduate course.

31 Jul 1988	initial version used in CS225 at UofQ

31 Jan 1989	added type, abstype, private, parameterless definitions

 4 Mar 1989	added operator sections

16 Jul 1989	general clean-up; use of "Standard" module

25 Jul 1989	#ifdef AMIGA sections [Bill Segall, Ross]

 6 Nov 1989	back end rewritten to use a Krivine machine;
		simplification of pattern compilation.  [Ross, Andrew Moran]
		output & comparison functions in "Standard". 

11 Mar 1990	edit command, and re-editing (RE_EDIT)

 3 Jul 1990	switched from reference counting to mark-scan garbage
		collection;
		added letrec/whererec; num as double. 

10 Mar 1991	improved re-editing (inspired by the Mocka system).
		re-organization of pattern matching, including best-fit
		and more efficient character matching.
		n+k pattern as abbreviation for succ^k(n).
		replaced update markers with stack frames.

		caught redefinition of values as constructors/constants
		and vice versa.
		changed treatment of primed type variables.

19 Jan 1993	regular types (i.e. type synonyms may be recursive).
		lazy expansion of type synonyms.

22 Feb 1993	'dec' declarations may be fulfilled by data constructors.

21 Apr 1993	automatic declaration and definition of 'map' functions
		corresponding to type and type constructor identifiers.
		They may be overridden with explicit definitions.

 4 Nov 1993	support for UTF-encoded Unicode characters.

25 Mar 1994	curried data and type constructors.
		made 'compare' available.

 1 Jul 1994	added options for use in a CGI.

15 Dec 1994	small extension to recursive type synonyms: permutations
		of arguments now allowed in recursive uses.

15 Mar 1995	cyclic types now printed using mu-notation.
		added mu-expressions.

16 Aug 1995	added the black hole optimization.

11 Jun 1997	added -f command line argument, #! hack and argv.
