Comparison of functions: this must be caught, or it will cause the
interpreter to go haywire.  It gets caught now, but it's not pretty.

Make it faster (how?)

Unification must be done on expanded types, but more unfolded types
should be instantiated to more compact ones.  This has been done, but
needs cleaning up.

Access to command line arguments, probably via a built-in constant
	argv : list(list char);
(This is done, but undocumented, as is #!)
