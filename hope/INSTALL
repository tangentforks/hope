INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

Unix:
	make install

That will put everything under /usr/local.  If you want them somewhere
else, set configure_args in the top-level Makefile.

Others:
	- you will need to adjust hopelib.h for the target machine.
	- copy *.[hc] and ../lib/*.hop to your machine.
	- bash it till it fits.

	The Hope error message:
		fatal error - can't read module 'Standard'
	indicates a slip-up in hopelib.h.

VARIABLES

You might wish to (un)define the following cpp variables:

	REALS	num.h		represent numbers as double, rather than long.
	STATS	runtime.c	produce statistics on space usage and the
				garbage collector.
	STATS	interpret.c	produce statistics on expressions entered.

There are also a number of variables in print.h which control the way
expressions, values and types are parenthesized on output.

You might also wish to adjust the variable MEMSIZE (in memory.c), which
controls the amount of data space used.
